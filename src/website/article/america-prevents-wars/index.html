         Human history can be divided into two periods.&nbsp;
         In the period before the U.S. became a superpower, all the world's nations, kingdoms,
         dynasties, and tribes continually jockeyed for territory and power.&nbsp;
         War was a permanent condition all around the planet, and territorial borders were in
         perpetual flux.&nbsp;
         Geopolitical maps rarely stayed current for more than a year or two.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         There was even a war in Europe during this period called the <b>Hundred Years' War</b>
         that lasted over a century!&nbsp;
         War was the default condition for humanity, but in the 1800s America planted the seeds of
         change.&nbsp;

         The Monroe Doctrine of 1823 outlawed new colonization in the Western Hemisphere.&nbsp;
         That historic foreign policy statement was the beginning of U.S. influence to compel all
         countries worldwide to respect sovereignty and end military imperialism.&nbsp;

      <h2>A New Superpower</h2>

         At the end of World War II the U.S. became a superpower and immediately the rate of wars began plummeting.&nbsp;
         Respect of sovereignty quickly became the norm.&nbsp;
         Today, most borders around the world are stable.&nbsp;
         Wars are now the exception not the norm.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Promoting freedom, human rights, and democracy is a team effort of many countries, and
         America is the superpower at the lead.&nbsp;
         <b>In all of human history, the U.S. is the single greatest factor in reducing the number
         of wars.</b>&nbsp;

      <h2>Stop Blaming America for the World's Problems</h2>
      <p>
         America is by far the most powerful and influential country, and it should surprise no one
         that we are involved in geopolitics worldwide.&nbsp;
         Leftists blaming the U.S. for the world's problems is like blaming a plumber for water
         leaks because plumbers get wet.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Leftists confuse involvement with military expansionism.&nbsp;
         While U.S. involvement has not been perfect, it's critical to understand that the U.S. has
         not used military force to expand its territory in over 100 years.&nbsp;
         The fact that America is the one and only country that gets held up to a standard of
         perfection is pretty clear evidence that we're not the villain self-hating
         leftists claim we are.&nbsp;

      <h2>World Peace</h2>

      <p>
         American Democrats want our great country involved in as few armed conflicts as possible,
         but we know that allowing the world to be overrun by dictators, warlords, and jihadists is
         a recipe for dramatically more wars in the future.&nbsp;
         In today's dangerous world, peace through strength is the only sensible path for America
         to take.&nbsp;
