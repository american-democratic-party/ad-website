         We know the climate is warming and human activity is the cause.&nbsp;
         Our children's future depends on transitioning everything to clean electric power as soon
         as possible, but we'll make the situation worse if we get irrational and let emotions
         cloud our thinking about the solution.&nbsp;

      <h2>Stop Oil has it Backwards</h2>
      <p>
         Stop Oil activists are following their emotions and focusing on the wrong end of the
         economic equation.&nbsp;
         If the extraction of oil is stopped in one location, it will simply be extracted from
         another location.&nbsp;
         Rather than trying to stop the <b>SUPPLY</b> of oil, we should focus on the <b>DEMAND</b>
         for oil.&nbsp;
         The international oil market is not a rational market, and OPEC will more than happily
         boost their oil production to fill in any external production disruptions.&nbsp;
         OPEC would love to have more market share.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Whenever the virtue signaling Stop Oil activists shut down an oil drilling operation all
         they accomplish is shifting oil production (and profits) to OPEC countries which
         ironically care the least about protecting the environment.&nbsp;
         To make matters worse, those countries are run by repressive regimes that are the source
         of much geopolitical instability.&nbsp;

      <p>
         The misguided activists do not reduce the amount of oil that gets burned into the
         atmosphere by even one drop.&nbsp;
         They should go super glue their hands to roads in Saudi Arabia and Iran.&nbsp;

      <h2>Norway's Oil is Good for the World</h2>

         <figcaption>Norway generates 99% of its electric power from clean renewable

      <p>
         Look to Norway for the real solution.&nbsp;
         Norway is a major oil producer, yet the country leads the world in EV adoption and
         generates 99% of their electricity from clean hydro, solar, and wind.&nbsp;
         Norway's oil production has enabled it to establish a large sovereign wealth fund that
         invests in infrastructure projects to electrify transportation, like building a network of
         EV charging stations.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Rather than being a contradiction, Norway is reducing oil consumption and demonstrating
         that it is an effective model for actually solving the Climate Crisis.&nbsp;

      <h2>Be Smart</h2>
      <p>
         All resource extraction worldwide should be done responsibly.&nbsp;
         We should incentivize resource extraction in the U.S. and like Norway invest the tax
         proceeds into clean electricity generation, grid scale storage, and smart grid
         technology.&nbsp;
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
         If we create the right incentives, we can increase domestic oil production such that it
         boosts the U.S. economy, makes the world more stable, and saves the climate.&nbsp;
