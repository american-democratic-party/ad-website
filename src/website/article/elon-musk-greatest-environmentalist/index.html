      <p>
         It's easy to forget that before Tesla supercharged the EV market, EVs were hideously uncool
         and every legacy car manufacture on earth was actively hostile to EVs.&nbsp;
         When Tesla introduced its original Roadster back in 2008 the marketshare of EVs was a
         minuscule fraction of 1%.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Legacy car manufactures bad mouthed EVs continually and at best put forward underpowered
         suboptimal hybrid vehicles that only appealed to the most insufferable pretend
         environmentalists.&nbsp;
         The situation was so bad that South Park dedicated an entire episode to mocking Toyota
         Prius hybrid owners for their pretentious virtue signaling.&nbsp;

         The EV market was stuck and going nowhere.&nbsp;
         Then Elon Musk published his bold plan to revolutionize the EV market.&nbsp;
         <b>Musk single-handedly kicked the entire legacy auto industry in the tail so hard they
         spit their teeth out.</b>&nbsp;
         Musk has sped up EV adoption by at least a decade and maybe even two decades.&nbsp;

      <h2>Democrats are Fake Environmentalists</h2>
      <p>
         Democrats have turned on Musk because they care more about ideology and virtue signaling
         than about actually saving the environment.&nbsp;
         While Democrats are busy whining, Musk is literally saving our atmosphere from
         destruction.&nbsp;

      <h2>Innovator's Dilemma for Legacy Manufactures</h2>
      <p>
         Tesla has been dedicated to 100% true EVs from day one.&nbsp;
         On the other hand, all the legacy car manufactures hedge their bets and produce suboptimal
         compromise EVs.&nbsp;
         A concrete example of this problem is how one of Ford's EV, the original <i>Mustang
         Mach-E</i>, had <b>2 km of extraneous wires weighing over 30 kg</b> because it used wire
         harnesses designed for Ford's gas vehicles.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         We encourage all car manufactures to prioritize building 100% pure EVs that are not
         hamstrung by designs and parts from gas or hybrid vehicles.&nbsp;
         America will be stronger when all American car manufactures are producing awesome pure
         EVs.&nbsp;

      <h2>Shock Therapy</h2>

      </figure>
      <p>
         Tesla was violent shock therapy to the legacy car manufacturers, and it's safe to say that
         Musk has done more than any other single person in human history to reduce air pollution
         and reverse climate change.&nbsp;
         All the deranged climate activists in the world combined can't hold a candle to Musk.&nbsp;
