      The pay gap in America today is essentially gone.  The 82 cents on the dollar statistic you often hear is completely explainable by *physical job danger* (such as underwater welder) and by *unpredictable work schedules* (such as consulting firm employees).
For comparison, liberals love the religion in Afghanistan but ignore the country's 12 cents on the dollar pay gap.
