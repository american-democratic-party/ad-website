   <summary><b>1.1</b> Keep Taxes as Low as Reasonably Possible</summary>
   <p>
      We believe in good government.&nbsp;
      In order to achieve good government, it's imperative to relentlessly do the hard work of
      continually reviewing government spending to cut waste and eliminate programs that have
      outlived their usefulness.&nbsp;
      We oppose attempts to dismantle the government, but we strongly believe in respecting the
      American taxpayers who are footing the bill.&nbsp;
   </p>
   <p>
      Everyone hates paying taxes.&nbsp;
      We have an obligation to keep taxes as low as reasonably possible.&nbsp;

      The government has an important role to play in ensuring every American has fair
      opportunities to succeed and pursue prosperity, but that should never be construed to
      diminish personal responsibility.&nbsp;

   <summary><b>2.1.1</b> Crime Causes Poverty</summary>
   <p>
      Democrats push a victimhood narrative that tries to justify crime by claiming that poverty
      causes crime.&nbsp;
      Democrats have it backwards.&nbsp;
      Poverty only nudges crime rates a small amount, but it's crime that causes poverty.&nbsp;
      There a many poor communities in the world with low crime, but every single community with
      high crime is poor or soon will be.&nbsp;
   </p>
   <p>
      Crime is a choice.&nbsp;
      Crime is devastating to mom and pop shops, local jobs, tourism, property values, and a
      community's tax base.&nbsp;
      Crime is a cancer on society.&nbsp;
      Crime causes poverty &mdash; <b>not</b> the reverse.&nbsp;

   <summary><b>2.2.1</b> America is the Least Racist Country in the World</summary>
   <p>
      Of the almost 200 countries in the world, the U.S. is the single least racist country in the
      entire world.&nbsp;
      Racism will never be 100% solved in any country, but America has achieved the greatest
      diversity of successful people on the planet.&nbsp;
   </p>
   <p>
      We are the only country to produce self-made billionaires from all major racial groups.&nbsp;
      American politicians and thought leaders come from all walks of life, and our strong freedom
      of speech protection applies to all ethnicities.&nbsp;

   <summary><b>2.2.2</b> DEI Needs to be Retired</summary>
   <p>
      Now that we're more than 50 years past the Civil Rights Era, DEI is doing more harm than good
      by forcing everyone to doubt the ability of every successful Black American.&nbsp;
      DEI steals agency away from Black Americans.&nbsp;
      Talented hard-working Black Americans who worked hard and earn their prosperity have
      their credibility undermined everyday by DEI.&nbsp;
   </p>
   <p>
      Sadly, leftists keep stoking the fire of racism.&nbsp;
      <b>Racism is oxygen to leftists.</b>&nbsp;
      If racism were to be eliminated tomorrow, leftists across the country would suffocate and
      die off en masse.&nbsp;
   </p>
   <p>
      ADs believe it's time to end the nonstop obsession with racism and turn our
      attention to building more prosperity for all Americans.&nbsp;

   <summary><b>2.3.1</b> Masks at Protests are a Threat of Violence</summary>
   <p>
      Wearing a mask or other face covering for anonymity at a protest is a deliberate act of
      intimidation and constitutes a threat of violence.&nbsp;
      While only a small minority of protestors wearing masks may plan to engage in violence
      themselves, all of the mask wearers are knowingly and intentionally providing cover for their
      fellow protestors who are hoping to commit assault.&nbsp;
   </p>
   <p>
      ADs do not wear masks while exercising our freedom of speech.&nbsp;
