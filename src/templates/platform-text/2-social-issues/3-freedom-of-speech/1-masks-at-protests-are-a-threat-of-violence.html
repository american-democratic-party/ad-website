   <summary>Masks at Protests are a Threat of Violence</summary>
   <p>
      Wearing a mask or other face covering for anonymity at a protest is a deliberate act of
      intimidation and constitutes a threat of violence.&nbsp;
      While only a small minority of protestors wearing masks may plan to engage in violence
      themselves, all of the mask wearers are knowingly and intentionally providing cover for their
      fellow protestors who are hoping to commit assault.&nbsp;

      ADs do not wear masks while exercising our freedom of speech.&nbsp;
