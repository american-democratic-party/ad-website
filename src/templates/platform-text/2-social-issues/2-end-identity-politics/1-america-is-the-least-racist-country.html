   <summary>America is the Least Racist Country in the World</summary>
   <p>
      Of the almost 200 countries in the world, the U.S. is the single least racist country in the
      entire world.&nbsp;
      Racism will never be 100% solved in any country, but America has achieved the greatest
      diversity of successful people on the planet.&nbsp;
   </p>
   <p>
      We are the only country to produce self-made billionaires from all major racial groups.&nbsp;
      American politicians and thought leaders come from all walks of life, and our strong freedom
      of speech protection applies to all ethnicities.&nbsp;
