   <summary>DEI Needs to be Retired</summary>
   <p>
      Now that we're more than 50 years past the Civil Rights Era, DEI is doing more harm than good
      by forcing everyone to doubt the ability of every successful Black American.&nbsp;
      DEI steals agency away from Black Americans.&nbsp;
      Talented hard-working Black Americans who worked hard and earn their prosperity have
      their credibility undermined everyday by DEI.&nbsp;

      Sadly, leftists keep stoking the fire of racism.&nbsp;
      <b>Racism is oxygen to leftists.</b>&nbsp;
      If racism were to be eliminated tomorrow, leftists across the country would suffocate and
      die off en masse.&nbsp;

   <p>
      American Democrats believe it's time to end the nonstop obsession with racism and turn our
      attention to building more prosperity for all Americans.&nbsp;
